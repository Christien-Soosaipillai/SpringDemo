<!-- This beans file is to show how default init and destroy methods can be set when you have
too many beans having init and destroy methods with the same name. Instead of declaring each "init-method" 
and "destroy-method" on each individual bean you can declare the group method for all beans within 
the <beans> tag-->

<!-- 
	 JavaBean is a Java object that satisfies certain programming conventions:
		
		1. The JavaBean class must implement either Serializable or Externalizable
		
		2. The JavaBean class must have a no-arg constructor
		
		3. All JavaBean properties must have public setter and getter methods
		
		4. All JavaBean instance variables should be private
		
		Example of JavaBeans
		
		@Entity
		public class Employee implements Serializable{
		
		   @Id
		   private int id;
		   private String name;   
		   private int salary;  
		
		   public Employee() {}
		
		   public Employee(String name, int salary) {
		      this.name = name;
		      this.salary = salary;
		   }
		   public int getId() {
		      return id;
		   }
		   public void setId( int id ) {
		      this.id = id;
		   }
		   public String getName() {
		      return name;
		   }
		   public void setName( String name ) {
		      this.name = name;
		   }
		   public int getSalary() {
		      return salary;
		   }
		   public void setSalary( int salary ) {
		      this.salary = salary;
		   }
		}
